It has been over half a year since the last update???! Oh my, hopefully I will be able to do this more frequently!


### Research

- `macrosystem`: funded.
- `phenobase`: funded.
- `career`: pending. This took most of my summer, reading, thinking, writing. I am not sure how good/bad it is, at least I have submitted it! Oh well, the waiting game starts.
- `sDiv`: pending. Still waiting for this, probably not going to be funded...
- `urbanEcoEvo`: attended a 3-day workshop in person; did not do this for a while and I think it is reasonably productive. Now have some ideas and projects planned.

### Teaching
 
- `datasci`: I will teach this course again this fall semester. Will try to update some materials, but things are just getting busy.

### Other

- `logistic`: had 2 more PhD students joined the lab.


# To do

- `rtrees`: need to change code to have data.table to speed things up
- `dragnet`: need to collect biomass and measure light (borrow light meter from Kyle)
- `nutnet`: need to review Flavia's code.
- `andeans`: need to read the New Phytologist paper and prepare for Tuesday's meeting.
- `phenobase`: need to prepare the first group meeting!
- `student`: Evelin's qualifying exam!
