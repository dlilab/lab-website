One week past, nothing seems been done. This is frustrating.

### Research

- `dragnet`: finally got a scale; but it is tiny, not what I really want. And it only reads to 0.1g. I guess I will just use it for this year; need to buy another one later
- `BoRRCS`: budget done, pretty much unchanged from last year.
- `macrosystem`: got some feedbacks back; need to revise it
- `phenobase`: got a workflow figure.

### Teaching
 
- `introDataSci`: Spend a lot of time on preparing the Intro to Data Sci course; I am just one lecture ahead now... sign.

### Other

- `logistic`: so many emails from prospective students, most of them are not even in Ecology... I stopped to respond to emails since it is just impossible to reply to each and every of them. Feel bad about it, but small amount of time each will add up.


# To do

- `grant`: need to start work with PhenoBase text; also need to work on macrosystem documents, which is now due Jan 10, 2022.
- `BoRRCS`: need to finish the revision.
- `dragnet`: need to prepare nutrients to be added to the site.
- `introDataSci`: develop materials for 1 more weeks.
- `collaborators`: I am so behind!!
