New semester here. Trying to get back to write notebooks regularly. No promise here given the pretty bad history records.

### Research

- `rtrees`: paper published already
- `nitfix`: NSF funded


### Teaching
 
- `datasci`: start teaching it again this semester

### Other

- `logistic`: hundreds of emails from perspective students waiting for me to go through ...

## Semester goal:

- [ ] `extreme_pheno`: get the paper submitted by the end of this semester
- [ ] `floraPhenology`: have a draft
- [ ] `phyreg`: shape out the ideas

- [ ] `phenoBase`: get training data sorted out; have a prototype for the deep learning model
- [ ] `invasionMacro`: get data compiled, and have analyses done for paper 1 (Grant)


# To do

- [ ] `sgubik`: need to get the dataset ready for the workshop! (species list, traits; traits can be really tricky...)
- [ ] `dragnet`: need to do the biomass collection and the treatments
- [ ] `lifeplan`: need to fix the cloud issue???
- [ ] `phenovar`: need to get the data to Pablo
- [ ] `extreme_pheno`: need to have preliminary results
