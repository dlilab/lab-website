# Have worked on

This week is mostly about ESA virtual meeting. Still feel so overwhelmed with tons of talks. Not really sure about how much new ideas I got from it. And today is the end of summer according to the Lunar calendar. Cannot believe that the first summer as a faculty is almost gone. Need to get something done before it is over.

### Research

- `dragnet`: with help from Matt, Evelin, and Logan, we set the site up.
- `greendown`: pushed some text, but still did not finish the revision.

### Teaching
 
- `introDataSci`: did not work on it; I really need to work on it next week.

### Other

- `logistic`: replied to at least 30-50 emails from perspective students; did not find good candidates yet.


# To do

- `dragnet`: need to finish pre-treatment survey; schedule a time with Chris Reid.
- `introDataSci`: develop materials for the first 2 weeks.
- `greendown`: finish revision and send it to co-authors!
- `grant`: reorganize the structure.
- `alphidtree`: need to get the phylogeny.
