# Have worked on

### Research

- `sGUBIK`: rejected by sDiv, some unfair comments from Reviewer #2. Well, it sucks.
- `greendown`: pushed some text, first round of respondes to reviewers' comments.
- `rtrees`: put together a shinny app by REU student; I tweaked it and put it online [here](http://djli.shinyapps.io/rtrees/); time to write the paper?

### Teaching
 
- `introDataSci`: put together a [website](http://introdatasci.dlilab.com/), a syllabus, and a flyer.

### Other

- `logistic`: try to hire a couple of undergrad students.


# To do

- `dragnet`: need to set up the plots
- `introDataSci`: develop materials for 1st week
- `greendown`: finish revision and send it to co-authors
- `grant`: get some money to do some science
- `nitfixreplot`: probably should get back to it?
