New semester here. And I am not teaching this semester! Hopefully will be able to catch up with research.


## Project ideas that I tend to lead:

1. [ ] `floraPhenology`: have a draft
2. [ ] `phyreg`: have a draft
3. [ ] `urbanITV`: explore the possibility?
4. [ ] `pheno_exp`: explore the idea. test the hypothesis; if promissing, write it up

## Project ideas others to lead:

1. [ ] `phenovar`: need to get the data to Pablo



## To do

- [ ] `sgubik`: need to get the dataset ready (traits, environmental, socio-economics, etc.)
- [ ] `dragnet`: need to do the burning and the treatments
- [ ] `lifeplan`: need to get enough people to work on it
