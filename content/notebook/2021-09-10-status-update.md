Cannot believe that it has been a month since the last update!

### Research

- `dragnet`: with help from Matt and Chris, we have finished the vegetation survey. Thanks to Chris, otherwise, we'd never finish it. Species identification skills are so important but yet so under-valued! I used to know lots of plants in WI, but here, I know nothing! And I cannot find a good book about the flora of Louisiana!
- `greendown`: send it back to reviewers, hopefully it will be a smooth review process; the tidyNEON paper is still under review since the submission in April, what the hell? I got it that it is hard to find reviewers nowadays, but 5 months and counting?? Yikes.
- `macrosystem`: the proposal is getting there, but I have no idea is it good or bad. Need more work on it.

### Teaching
 
- `introDataSci`: Spend a lot of time on preparing the Intro to Data Sci course; but still just got about three weeks' materials there.

### Other

- `logistic`: hired one undergrad student, hope to get another one to cover this semester's lifeplan sampling.


# To do

- `grant`: send it out for comments; start working on other documents.
- `BoRRCS`: get the NOI in.
- `dragnet`: need to finish treatment, at least disturbance. We may add nutrient at the beginning of the growing season.
- `introDataSci`: develop materials for 2 more weeks.
