### Research

So far mostly worked on grant proposals; not much on manuscript side.

- `macrosystem`: Submitted it back in January.
- `phenobase`: Finally submitted it after a long time.

### Teaching
 
- `ecology`: Spend a lot of time on preparing the first half of the Principles in Ecology course.

### Other

- `logistic`: so hopefully to get 2 more PhD students to join us this fall.


# To do

- `grant`: need to start thinking about topics for CAREER, lots of reading this month!
