It happened again. Another month without update, oh well

### Research

- `dragnet`: Finished soil tiling and biomass collection. Tiling clay soil is just not trivial. We need super heavy-duty machines! Human hands are pretty much useless here.
- `greendown`: revision done, hopefully it will be accepted soon??
- `macrosystem`: have a draft of the proposal, send out for friendly reviews.
- `phenobase`: get budget there, not finalized yet.

### Teaching
 
- `introDataSci`: Spend a lot of time on preparing the Intro to Data Sci course; I am just one lecture ahead now... sign.

### Other

- `logistic`: so many emails from prospective students, most of them are not even in Ecology...


# To do

- `grant`: need to start work with PhenoBase text; also need to work on macrosystem documents, which is now due Jan 10, 2022.
- `BoRRCS`: need to get the budget into the system.
- `dragnet`: need to finish biomass weighting, and prepare nutrients to be added to the site.
- `introDataSci`: develop materials for 1 more weeks.
- `collaborators`: I am so behind!!
