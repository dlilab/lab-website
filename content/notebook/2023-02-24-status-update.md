### Research

It has been almost half a year since last update here. Sign. 

- `rtrees`: waiting for the editor forever
- `seminar`: gave a couple of seminars
- `lifeplan`: hopefully it goes well

### Teaching
 
- `ecology`: it went well so far, still need to spend sometime to prepare for each lecture, but much better than the first time

### Other

- `logistic`: ordered materials and tools for Dragnet project.


# To do

- [ ] `floraPhenology`: need to pick it up and start writing
- [ ] `macrob`: need to think about summer REU options, did not send out job description yet
- [ ] `phenobase`: need to get two undergraduate students to help with image scoring! Also to talk about where to save the downloaded images from iNat
- [ ] `dragnet`: need to ship the soil and share the data
- [ ] `lifeplan`: need to review last year's data, ship the samples too, and fix the cloud issue???

- [ ] `labmtg`: need to work a little bit more and see how the project goes

- [ ] `project`: need to think about what project to do next, going out of manuscript now...
    + simulation of phylogenies and pglmm?
    + var in phenology? Need to find sometime to get this one ready
