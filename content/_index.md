     <p class="condensedlines">Three years in, and we finally had a chance to take an in-person lab group picture (05/05)! It has been a really challenging journey so far but I am glad that we have a great team now. Left to right: Ariel Mata, Sydne Martin, Tina Nguyen, Daijiang Li, Rohit Jha, Pablo Moreno, Evelin Reyes, Flavia Montaño.</p>
